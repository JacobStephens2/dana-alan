# Dana Alan for West Vincent Township&nbsp;Supervisor

I believe that West Vincent is a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a&nbsp;family.

As a Township Supervisor, I intend to be an active listener to the concerns of our residents. I won’t enter into this position with preconceived ideas of how things should be done. To help us move forward as a community, it is important to hear all viewpoints. In this same vein, I feel that civility is the cornerstone to cooperation. Open and transparent dialogue with residents and business owners should always be welcomed and&nbsp;respected.

While I will respect the opinions and suggestions of the other supervisors, I will always think for myself and keep an open mind, keeping the residents and business owners best interests as my main&nbsp;priority.

My goals are to find ways to encourage more community involvement, engage the ingenuity and creativity of our citizens and welcome the participation of younger and more diverse voices that need to be heard in order to stay on a path of empowerment. We must find ways to honor our West Vincent history while embracing the changes that must be made for a positive&nbsp;future.
