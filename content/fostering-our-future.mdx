# Fostering Our Future&nbsp;Through:

## Financial Stability

As a fiscally-minded businessperson, I will work to ensure responsible use of our tax dollars to minimize expenditures and maximize results. Our current supervisors, working with Township Manager John Granger, are doing an admirable job of finding ways to improve our township facilities and parks through available grants and sound financial decisions. I plan to continue that mindset of conserving our resources through intelligent capital&nbsp;improvements.

## Communication

I believe local government works best when clear and concise information is easily available to the public. I am committed to driving ongoing and accessible township updates via our WVT website, through social media channels, from a diverse series of educational forums for residents where helpful insights are shared and dialogue is welcome, and by enhancing the inner-connectivity between our committees and with the&nbsp;public.

## Community

I have always been enthusiastic about community-building events and other collaborative opportunities. I also strongly support promoting our various parks and the Fellowship Garden as healthy lifestyle choices that also bolster our ecosystems. I am for maintaining and expanding our trail&nbsp;systems.

I am encouraged by the vibrant retail developments slated to occur within Weatherstone Flats, where unique shops, important human services, and convenient restaurants – all offered with walkable/bikeable ease – will help to keep our residents localized, happy, and supporting one&nbsp;another.

## Supporting our Police&nbsp;Force

We are fortunate to have such a wonderful police force under the direction of Chief Mike Swininger, who is dedicated to our citizen’s safety and well-being. I’m particularly impressed by his forward-thinking establishment of an advisory committee of residents, working to facilitate reform and promoting a better future for all, through the Youth Aid Panel.

Where else can you find a police force so supportive of protecting our residents through their varied endeavors? – from directing traffic for the Litter Lifters, to shutting down roads during amphibian&nbsp;crossings.

The West Vincent Police make even our smallest concerns their top&nbsp;priorities.

## Parks and Recreation

Work with our Parks & Recreation Commission as well as our residents to enhance public use and enjoyment of our beautiful parks and work with our Supervisors and township manager to continue to find grants to fund&nbsp;improvements.

## Sustainability

Work with our Sustainability Committee as well as our residents to find ways to lower our environmental impact, while being mindful…. such as moving our township facilities towards 100% renewable&nbsp;energy.

We are already making progress. We just purchased our first hybrid vehicle for our Police Department, are moving our township facilities towards 100% renewable energy, and plan to work with Homeowner Associations’ on Solar&nbsp;Panels.

We must always be mindful of our effects on people, profits, and our&nbsp;planet.

## Open Space

Work with our Open Space Review Board as well as our residents to use our designated open space funds wisely in order to increase our property values, lower our tax burden, and benefit the health of the environment and the quality of life of our&nbsp;residents.
By continuing to conserve our land we reduce the congestion on our roads and increase our personal health and welfare. Protected open space improves the quality of life for all of&nbsp;us!

## Diversity and Inclusion

We need to invite diverse and younger voices into the local government, to ensure the township’s vitality far into the future. I will work to engage and inspire our younger residents to participate through involvement and&nbsp;education.

## Supporting our Public Works&nbsp;Department

They do so much for us that goes unnoticed, just because they are continually on top of things - from maintaining our park lands to removing downed trees - we need to give our road crew the tools they require to serve us well, with minimal downtime and maximum&nbsp;productivity.
